This game is designed in memory of those killed by Covid-19.

You can run the game on PC by clicking "Eric_Portfolio.exe" in this folder.

Upon loading into the game scene, use W/A/S/D for control, just like you would in similar games.

Shoot the different variations of Covid virus to kill them and score. Enemies might drop power-up items upon death.

Getting hit by enemy bullets or enemy themselves will result in HP loss or power-down.

Enjoy the game, remember to wash your hands, and stay safe!
